				<p class="lead">What is NURSA?</p>
				<p>The Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) is a co-operative agreement (DK097748) awarded by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases to Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), with additional support from the National Institute of Child Health and Development. It supports an Informatics Hub as well as the competitive NURSA Data Source Project program, open annually and funded by subcontracts to individual investigators from BCM.</p>
				<p>The mission of NURSA is to accrue, develop, and communicate information that advances our understanding of the roles of nuclear receptors (NRs) and coregulators in human physiology and disease. The NURSA website has been developed over the past decade into a comprehensive source of information about NRs and their co-regulators, ligands, and downstream transcriptional targets.</p>
				<p>New features, enhancements and patches that have not yet been released to this public website may be reviewed at our <a href="https://beta.nursa.org">Beta site</a>. NURSA welcomes feedback on the production and Beta hub websites via its <a href="mailto:support@nursa.org">support@nursa.org</a>.</p>

				<p>Data from external resources are refreshed every six months through an automated pipeline that extracts, transforms and loads data into the database. Some data, such as clinical trials, then undergo additional manual validation by NURSA curators. The exception is the Transcriptomine target gene search engine, for which datasets are annotated and curated by NURSA staff and uploaded to Transcriptomine on a continuous basis.</p>

				<p>This may be due to a browser issue. We recommend using the following browsers: Firefox 24+, Chrome 30+, Safari 5.1.9+, and IE9+. The NURSA hub uses responsive design, so the site will render slightly differently on smaller mobile devices than it would on larger laptop or desktop screens. It has been optimized for a 15" laptop. For larger or smaller screens on non-mobile devices, you may need to adjust the zoom within your web browser to maximize your user experience.

			<div class="clearfix">
				<p class="lead">How does NURSA define a nuclear receptor coregulator?</p>
				<p>Nuclear receptor coregulators are molecules that interact with nuclear receptors and are required by nuclear receptors for efficient activation or repression of gene expression. Note that coactivation or corepression are contextual properties that can often coexist in the same molecule, and for this reason NURSA does designate coregulators explicitly as coactivators or corepressors. Inclusion of a molecule in the NURSA coregulator database requires a peer-reviewed publication showing (a) interaction with a nuclear receptor and (b) loss-of-function or gain-of-function data demonstrating its contribution to the activity of a nuclear receptor in a standard cell biology assay.</p>

				<p class="lead">What is the NURSA Symbol?</p>
				<p>Approved gene symbols have been defined for many genes in humans, mouse, rat and other species, and are commonly used in large scale, discovery driven Ã”omics studies. In many cases however, these are not in common use in specific fields such as cell biology &#8211; for example, p53 is more commonly referred as p53 than as TP53, its approved symbol. In order to make the website as accessible as possible to as wide a user audience as possible, we use the NURSA Symbol, e.g. p53, to indicate the name in common use in the field, and define the approved symbol, e.g.TP53, in specific ortholog sections of the Molecule Pages. When searching for a molecule in the search text field, the synonyms for a gene will be followed by the NURSA symbol in parentheses, e.g. TP53 (p53).</p>

				<p class="lead">What is the difference between a ligand and a drug?</p>
				<p>The addition of the Drug section to the NURSA Molecule Pages is one of the new features of the website added to make it more accessible to clinicians and physicians in the nuclear receptor signaling field. With a few exceptions, the term ligand in the context of nuclear receptors is classically taken to refer to a molecule that interacts with and modulates that AF-2 function of the nuclear receptor ligand binding domain. Although many well-known drugs &#8211; tamoxifen and cortisol for example, are also classical nuclear receptor ligands, many do not meet this definition, and target other nuclear receptor functions. For this reason. although there are many overlaps, we have annotated Drugs and Ligands separately.</p>

				<p>Experiment Names in Transcriptomine are expressed as </p>

				<p>The value in the Fold Change column reflects the ratio</p>
				<p class="text-center">Expression level under Condition x/Expression level in Condition y</p>

				<p>A Fold Change value &gt;1 corresponds to <b>upregulation</b> or <b>induction</b> of the gene in condition x relative to condition y. For example, a fold change of 4.32 for GREB1 in the experiment 17&#946;-estradiol vs control indicates that 17&#946;-estradiol induces GREB1 approximately 4 fold in that experiment. </p>

				<p>A Fold Change value &lt;1 corresponds to <b>down-regulation</b> or <b>repression</b> in condition x relative to condition y. For example, a fold change of 0.5 of NCOA3 in 17&#946;-estradiol vs control indicates that NCOA3 is downregulated 2-fold by 17&#946;-estradiol in that experiment.</p>

			<p class="lead">Where do the data originate?</p>

			<p>A three-part Perl script was used with NCBI's eUtils to identify and download journal abstracts from studies investigating NR, NR ligand and coregulator-dependent gene expression specifically in the context of genome-wide technologies such as microarray and RNA-Seq (see Supplementary File S2 for a list of molecule terms). Fold changes were extracted preferentially from public high throughput database repositories containing full datasets (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and EBI ArrayExpress) or, when these were unavailable, were manually retrieved from investigator-curated gene lists published in journal articles and supplementary files.</p>

			<p class="lead">How are fold changes calculated in Transcriptomine?</p>

			<p>Expression data obtained from GEO and ArrayExpress are the investigator provided summarized and normalized array feature expression intensities available in the series matrix or processed files respectively. The full set of processed and normalized sample expression values provided by the investigator were extracted and processed in the statistical program R. To calculate differential gene expression for investigator-defined experimental contrasts, we used the linear modeling functions from the Bioconductor limma analysis package. Initially, a linear model was fitted to a group-means parameterization design matrix defining each experimental variable. Subsequently, a contrast matrix was fitted which recapitulated the sample contrasts of interest as defined in the study producing fold change and significance values for each array feature present on the array. P-values obtained from Limma analysis were not corrected for multiple comparisons. In cases where a given gene was represented on an array by more than one probeset, data from individual probesets were generated separately and fold change values were not pooled across array features. Where the full raw dataset was unavailable (i.e. had not been deposited in a public repository), fold change and significance values were transcribed directly from journal and supplementary tables as reported by the investigator. For both sources of gene expression data, individual identifiers provided by the investigator or on the array were mapped to the current Entrez Gene identifier.</p>

			<p class="lead">Are fold change values logged or unlogged?</p>

			<p>Fold changes in TM are unlogged to facilitate their interpretation, especially for those investigators who may not have extensive experience interpreting logged values. For example, a fold change value of 2.0 in TM is equal to a 2-fold increase in expression and a fold change value of 0.5 in TM is equal to a 2-fold decrease in expression.</p>

			<div class="clearfix">
			<p class="lead">Are fold changes cross-normalized across different experiments?</p>

			<p>Fold changes are not cross-normalized across different experiments in Transcriptomine. Fold changes are inherently comparable across different datasets and do not require normalization. In any case, for many experiments authors do not deposit raw data in public repositories and so unprocessed values, which are required for cross-normalization, are not available. </p>

			<div class="clearfix">
			<p class="lead">How are data annotated?</p>

			<p>In addition to basic annotations such as species(human, mouse or rat), gene fold change value, direction, significance and regulating molecule, experiments were annotated for a number of variables known  to be critical determinants of the transcriptional response to NRs and their ligands. (i) Ligand concentration The transcriptional function of NRs is known to be closely linked to the amount of ligand available for binding, and receptor-ligand pairs have been postulated to act as rheostats which function to fine tune the transcriptional response in a given tissue. Moreover, many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenol A are biologically active only at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than natural agonists for the NR in question. As such, the ligand concentration at which regulation of a specific gene is observed is a critical experimental descriptor. (ii) Length of ligand exposure. Experimental systems yield distinct transcriptional profiles based on the length of time they are exposed to NR ligand. Rapid non-genomic signaling by 17&#946;-estradiol, for example, elicits transcriptional responses within minutes that differ fundamentally from those elaborated after multiple hours of exposure, when the genomic effects of liganded estrogen receptors are manifest. (iii) RNA Source. Tissue and cell line identity are important determinants of transcriptional and functional endpoints of NR signaling pathways. For example, the breast cancer drug Tamoxifen, while an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist in the breast, has partial ER agonist activity in the uterus and ER agonist activity in the skeleton and induction or repression of the same gene by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists has been shown to be a function of cell type. In order to align our RNA source annotations with published standards, we used the EFO Experimental Factor Ontology and the CL cell type ontology where possible.</p>

			<div class="clearfix">
			<p class="lead">Why does my query generate 0 FCs?</p>

			<p>There are two possible explanations for this. </p>

			<p>The first is that the default fold change and significance p-value cut-offs are too strict. While FC = 2 and p &lt;0.05 are common cut-off values they do not serve everyone's purpose. Try relaxing these using the Other option in the pulldown. Selecting Any in the Significance field will retrieve all p-values, including fold changes from experiments with unreported p-values (Not reported), in which the original investigators did not report p-values. Note that Not reported p-values may actually be significant, but because no numerical value was provided in the publication, we are unable to determine whether they are or not.</p>

			<p>The second possibility is simply that the database currently does not contain the data points you are seeking. We are currently making our way through curating a backlog of studies and Transcriptomine is updated on a continuous basis, so it is possible that data points corresponding to your query will be added to the Transcriptomine database in future. </p>

			<p>These experiments are typically one of a series of experiments which would make more sense when viewed side-by-side with the other experiments in the dataset.

			<div class="clearfix">
			<p class="lead">Why do I get conflicting fold changes for the same transcript under apparently the same condition?</p>

			<p>There are several possible reasons for this. </p>

			<p>(a) Differential regulation of a given transcript over time. If the two experiments involve a ligand, check the ligand treatment time for each contrast by clicking on the fold change to open the Fold Change Detail window.</p>

			<p>(b) Differential regulation of a given by different ligand concentrations or doses. The effect of NR ligands has been shown to be concentration-dependent in certain contexts, at least in vitro. If the conflicting fold changes involve a ligand, check the ligand concentration or dose for each contrast by clicking on the fold change to open the Fold Change Detail window.</p>

			<p>(c) Differential regulation of isoforms Alternative regulation of transcripts encoding different isoforms of the same gene has been demonstrated. In experiments where the raw data were available, the specific probeset ID and the array type code are shown in the Identifier (Type) column (refer to FAQ ...... for a list of current array codes and the full names of the arrays). If investigators did not deposit their raw data, but provided GenBank identifiers, these are displayed in the Identifier (Type) column, e.g. NM_014668 (GB). </p>

			<p>Options for resolving array probeset IDs and accession numbers include</p>

			</ul>    

			<p>(d) Tissue-specific regulation of a given gene. The number of promoters regulated in a tissue-specific manner has been estimated at 20% of active promoters in the mouse (Barrera et al. (2008) Genome Research <b>18</b>, 46-59) and the opposing effects of GR ligands on a given gene in different tissues have been documented (see Feltus et al.

				<b>High visibility within the field</b>  
				<p>Your work is freely accessible to a global audience. In addition, articles are available through INIST in France and in e-Depot, the National Library of the Netherlands' digital archive of all electronic publications. We are also in discussion with other permanent digital archives including the British Library.</p>
				<b>Permanence</b>
				<p>All articles published in <em>Nuclear Receptor Signaling</em> are archived in a number of safe open access archives so permanent accessibility is assured.</p>

				<p class="lead">What is Open Access?</p>
				<p>All articles published in <em>Nuclear Receptor Signaling</em> are open access, which means they are freely and universally accessible online, and permanently archived in an internationally recognized open access repository, such as PubMed Central.</p>
				<b>Article-processing charges</b>
				<p>As the cost of peer reviewing, editing, publishing, maintaining and archiving articles is not recouped through subscription charges, a standard article-processing charge (APC) is levied on all articles that are accepted for publication. The APC is a flat charge, and no additional costs are incurred, for example, by the inclusion of color figures. The current APC for <em>Nuclear Receptor Signaling</em> is Â£1170/$1990/Ã›1480.</p>
				<p>You may be aware that an increasing number of funding agencies strongly encourage open access publication and explicitly allow the use of grants to cover APCs. Some, such as the Wellcome Trust, insist that all research funded by them is open access on publication. </p>
				<p>In cases where neither the authors nor their institution or funder are able to pay the APC, a discount or waiver may be granted. There is currently an automatic waiver for authors from low or lower-middle income countries (according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldbank.org/data/countryclass/classgroups.htm">World Bank criteria</a>). Requests for waivers should be made as part of the online submission process.</p>
				<b>Benefits of open access</b>  
				<ul>
					<li>Open access articles are freely available via the internet and are therefore more widely visible than articles published behind subscription barriers, with some studies suggesting that on average open access articles are twice as likely to be cited.</li>  
					<li>Retaining copyright means that authors can reproduce and distribute their work as they choose, for example on their institution's website.</li>  
					<li>Open access publication benefits the scientific community by making results of research immediately and freely available to all.</li>

				<p class="lead">If my article is published, how will it be cited?</p>

				<p>Articles in <em>Nuclear Receptor Signaling</em> should be cited in the same way as articles in a traditional journal. However, because articles in this journal are not printed, they do not have page numbers. Instead, they have a unique article number.</p>

				<p>The following citation:</p>

				<p><em>Nucl Recept Signal</em> 2005, <strong>6</strong>:306</p>

				<p>refers to article 306 from Volume 6 of the journal. </p>

				<p>As an online journal, <em>Nuclear Receptor Signaling</em> does not have issue numbers. Each volume corresponds to a calendar year.</p>

				<p>NURSA provides funding for pilot and feasibility (P&amp;F) awards as part of its NURSA Data Source Projects (NDSP) arm. These awards are made possible largely through support from the NIDDK and also NICHD. The NURSA Bioinformatics Hub facilitates the P&amp;F awards through the RFP notifications and online applications on its web portal (www.nursa.org). As RFPs are released, the NDSPs will be openly competed and peer reviewed. Each funding cycle will have one or two focus areas, which are selected by members of the NIDDK and a steering committee. Please view our <h:link value = "NDSP RFP" outcome = "/funding/ndsp_rfp.jsf"/> page to learn more about upcoming, current and past RFPs. To learn more about funded NDSP projects, please see our <h:link value = "NURSA-funded Projects" outcome = "/funding/nursa_projects.jsf"/> page.</p>

				<p>NDSP investigators must utilize the Hub for submitting proposals, distributing information about NURSA-funded reagents and sharing NURSA-funded datasets. It is expected that funded investigators must freely share NURSA-funded reagents with other researchers upon request, but NDSP investigators may charge a nominal fee for reimbursing their expenses for reagent processing and shipping. Further, NDSP PIs will serve as members of the NURSA Steering Committee, with bimonthly meetings.</p>
