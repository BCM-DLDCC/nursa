		<p>To the biomedical research community,</p>
		<p>Welcome to the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) 3.0.</p>

		<p>The mission of NURSA is to accrue, develop, and communicate information that advances our understanding of the roles of nuclear receptors (NRs) in human diseases and conditions in which NRs play an integral role.  An interdisciplinary approach will result in the generation of new and complex datasets, leading to a more complete understanding of the role of NRs in the physiology and pathophysiology of common and chronic diseases including diabetes, obesity, metabolic dysregulation, response to the environment, and reproductive diseases and disorders. </p>

		<p>sNURSA began in 2002 with the objective to accrue, develop and communicate information about the nuclear receptor superfamily.  Over the last ten years, NURSA has developed a website that has developed into a comprehensive source of information about nuclear receptors, and their co-regulators, ligands, and downstream targets. Through a series of integrated 'omics-scale and informatic approaches projects, NURSA has has fostered a systems biology understanding of nuclear receptor function, physiology and regulation of target gene networks in vivo.</p>

		<p>The current NURSA Hub replaces the previous NURSA structure and is co-funded by NIDDK and NICHD.  This NURSA Hub will continue to maintain the NURSA molecule pages, databases, and public portal, as well as the online peer-reviewed e-journal Nuclear Receptor Signaling (NRS).  The Hub will provide a mechanism by which the information within this discovery/validation platform can be kept current and vital and be used by the broader research community.  To provide innovative research input, the Hub will periodically solicit a series of NURSA data source projects (NDSP) from within and beyond the nuclear receptor community.  Through a multi-disciplinary approach, these projects are expected to provide insight into the physiological and pathophysiological role of nuclear receptor signaling within the context of tissue and cell specific gene regulation.  The PIs of these NDSPs will form a consortium of NURSA investigators that will contribute to the data flow to the NURSA Hub and will work together to elucidate the role of nuclear receptors in human metabolic and reproductive disease.  We encourage you to peruse the NURSA webpage and investigate the rich data resources available, to apply to the NDSP announcements, to contribute to the datasets supported by the Hub, and to read the online journal NRS.</p>

		<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

		<p>Funding for NURSA is provided through grant DK097748 from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) with supplemental funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD).
